  80 days around the world, we'll find a pot of gold just sitting where
  the rainbow's ending. Time - we'll fight against the time, and we'll fly
  on the white wings of the wind. 80 days around the world, no we won't
  say a word before the ship is really back. Round, round, all around the
  world. Round, all around the world. Round, all around the world. Round,
  all around the world. Ulysses, Ulysses - Soaring through all the
  galaxies. In search of Earth, flying in to the night. Ulysses, Ulysses -
  Fighting evil and tyranny, with all his power, and with all of his
  might. Ulysses - no-one else can do the things you do. Ulysses - like a
  bolt of thunder from the blue. Ulysses - always fighting all the evil
  forces bringing peace and justice to all. Ben Hall
